Certainly! Self-hosting a Docker registry on an Ubuntu server allows you to have full control over your Docker images and can enhance security and performance by keeping your images within your own infrastructure. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to set up a private Docker registry on an Ubuntu server.

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. **Ubuntu Server**: Ensure you have an Ubuntu server (version 18.04, 20.04, or later) with administrative access.

2. **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed on your server.
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```
   - Verify Docker installation:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

3. **Domain Name (Optional but Recommended)**: Having a domain name pointing to your server's IP can simplify SSL setup.

4. **Firewall Configured**: Ensure that ports 80 and 443 (or any custom ports you choose) are open.

---

## **Step 1: Set Up a Basic Docker Registry**

Docker provides an official image for the registry.

### **1.1 Run the Registry Container**

- Run the Docker registry container on port 5000 (default port):
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
  ```

### **1.2 Test the Registry**

- Tag an existing image and push it to your registry.
  ```bash
  docker pull alpine
  docker tag alpine localhost:5000/alpine
  docker push localhost:5000/alpine
  ```
- Pull the image back from the registry to test:
  ```bash
  docker rmi localhost:5000/alpine
  docker pull localhost:5000/alpine
  ```

**Note**: Pushing to a registry over HTTP is insecure and generally not recommended. Let's secure it using SSL.

---

## **Step 2: Secure the Registry with SSL**

To securely communicate with your registry, you should set up SSL encryption.

### **2.1 Generate SSL Certificates**

You can use self-signed certificates or obtain certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt.

#### **Option A: Self-Signed Certificates**

**Generate Self-Signed Certificate**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/certs
openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout ~/certs/domain.key \
  -x509 -days 365 -out ~/certs/domain.crt
```

- When prompted, fill out the required information. For "Common Name," use your server's domain name or IP address.

**Create Certificate Directory**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/your.domain.com:5000
sudo cp ~/certs/domain.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/your.domain.com:5000/ca.crt
```

#### **Option B: Using Let's Encrypt (Recommended)**

**Install Certbot**

```bash
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

**Obtain Certificates**

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your.domain.com
```

Certificates will be stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/`.

### **2.2 Configure the Registry with SSL**

**Stop Existing Registry Container**

```bash
docker stop registry
docker rm registry
```

**Run Registry with SSL**

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 443:5000 \
  --restart=always \
  --name registry \
  -v /path/to/certs:/certs \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:5000 \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \
  registry:2
```

- Replace `/path/to/certs` with:
  - For self-signed: `~/certs`
  - For Let's Encrypt: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com`

**Update Docker Daemon to Trust Self-Signed Certificates (If Using Self-Signed)**

On **clients** that will connect to the registry:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/your.domain.com
sudo cp ~/certs/domain.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/your.domain.com/ca.crt
```

Restart Docker daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

---

## **Step 3: Secure the Registry with Authentication**

To prevent unauthorized access, set up basic authentication.

### **3.1 Install `htpasswd` Utility**

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

### **3.2 Create a Password File**

```bash
mkdir ~/auth
docker run --entrypoint htpasswd httpd:2 -Bbn username password > ~/auth/htpasswd
```

- Replace `username` and `password` with your desired credentials.

### **3.3 Run Registry with Authentication and SSL**

```bash
docker stop registry
docker rm registry

docker run -d \
  -p 443:5000 \
  --restart=always \
  --name registry \
  -v /path/to/certs:/certs \
  -v ~/auth:/auth \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:5000 \
  -e "REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt" \
  -e "REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

---

## **Step 4: Configure Docker Clients**

### **4.1 Log In to Your Registry**

On any client that wants to push/pull images:

```bash
docker login your.domain.com
```

- Enter the username and password you set up earlier.

### **4.2 Tag and Push an Image**

```bash
docker pull alpine
docker tag alpine your.domain.com/alpine
docker push your.domain.com/alpine
```

### **4.3 Pull the Image Back**

```bash
docker pull your.domain.com/alpine
```

---

## **Step 5: Persisting Data**

By default, the registry stores data inside the container. To persist data:

### **5.1 Create a Data Directory**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/registry-data
```

### **5.2 Run Registry with Volume Mount**

Include the volume in your `docker run` command:

```bash
-v ~/registry-data:/var/lib/registry
```

**Complete Command:**

```bash
docker stop registry
docker rm registry

docker run -d \
  -p 443:5000 \
  --restart=always \
  --name registry \
  -v ~/registry-data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /path/to/certs:/certs \
  -v ~/auth:/auth \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:5000 \
  -e "REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt" \
  -e "REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

---

## **Step 6: Setting Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy (Optional)**

Using Nginx can help manage SSL termination, handle multiple services, and improve security.

### **6.1 Install Nginx**

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

### **6.2 Configure Nginx**

Create a new configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker-registry
```

**Add the following configuration:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your.domain.com;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your.domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/domain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/domain.key;

    client_max_body_size 0;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header  Host              $http_host;   # required for docker client's sake
        proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP         $remote_addr; # pass on real client's IP
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout                  900;
    }
}
```

- Replace `/path/to/domain.crt` and `/path/to/domain.key` accordingly.

### **6.3 Enable the Configuration**

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker-registry /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### **6.4 Update Registry to Listen on localhost**

Modify the registry to listen only on localhost since Nginx will handle external traffic.

**Update the `docker run` command:**

```bash
-e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## **Step 7: Regular Maintenance**

### **7.1 Renew SSL Certificates**

If using Let's Encrypt, set up auto-renewal:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

**Add the following line:**

```cron
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --post-hook "systemctl reload nginx"
```

### **7.2 Clean Up Unused Images**

To save disk space, periodically clean up unreferenced blobs.

- **Enable Deletion in Registry Configuration**

Create a configuration file `config.yml`:

```yaml
version: 0.1
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
http:
  addr: 127.0.0.1:5000
  headers:
    X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
delete:
  enabled: true
```

**Run Registry with Configuration File:**

```bash
-v ~/registry-data:/var/lib/registry \
-v /path/to/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml \
-e REGISTRY_CONFIGURATION_PATH=/etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```

- **Run Garbage Collection**

```bash
docker exec -it registry bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```

---

## **Step 8: Secure the Server**

### **8.1 Keep System Updated**

Regularly update your Ubuntu server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### **8.2 Configure Firewall**

Use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw enable
```

### **8.3 Monitor Logs**

Keep an eye on Docker and Nginx logs for any suspicious activity.

- Docker logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs registry
  ```
- Nginx logs:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  ```

---

## **Step 9: Use DNS Entries (If Applicable)**

Ensure that your domain (`your.domain.com`) points to your server's IP address.

- Update your DNS records with an A record pointing to the server IP.

---

## **Step 10: Additional Tips**

- **Backup Data**: Regularly back up the `registry-data` directory to prevent data loss.
- **High Availability**: For production, consider setting up a clustered registry or use storage backends like Amazon S3.
- **Automate with Docker Compose**: Simplify management with a `docker-compose.yml` file.

**Example `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  registry:
    image: registry:2
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    environment:
      REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR: 0.0.0.0:5000
      REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE: /certs/domain.crt
      REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY: /certs/domain.key
      REGISTRY_AUTH: htpasswd
      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: Registry Realm
      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: /auth/htpasswd
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/registry
      - ./certs:/certs
      - ./auth:/auth
```

Run with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you've set up a secure, private Docker registry on your Ubuntu server. This registry can now be used to store and share Docker images within your organization securely.

If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

Apologies for the misunderstanding earlier.

To expose your Docker registry using CloudPanel on your subdomain, you can configure CloudPanel to act as a reverse proxy to the Docker registry. This way, you can take advantage of CloudPanel's features like SSL management, while securely exposing your Docker registry through a subdomain.

Here's how you can achieve this:

---

## **Overview**

1. **Set Up the Docker Registry**
   - Run the Docker registry container bound to localhost.
2. **Create a New Website in CloudPanel**
   - Set up a new site with your subdomain.
3. **Configure Nginx in CloudPanel**
   - Set up reverse proxy settings to forward requests to the Docker registry.
4. **Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt via CloudPanel**
   - Secure your subdomain with SSL.
5. **Test and Verify the Setup**
   - Ensure everything works as expected.

---

## **Detailed Steps**

### **Prerequisites**

- **CloudPanel Installed**: On your Ubuntu server.
- **Docker Installed**: Ensure Docker is running on your server.
- **Subdomain Configured**: DNS A record pointing `registry.example.com` to your server's IP.
- **SSH Access**: To manage Docker and configurations.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up the Docker Registry**

#### **1.1 Run the Docker Registry Container**

Run the Docker registry bound to localhost to prevent direct external access.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 \
  -v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /opt/registry/auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `-p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000`: Binds port 5000 on localhost only.
  - `-v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry`: Persists registry data.
  - `-v /opt/registry/auth:/auth`: Mounts authentication directory.
  - Authentication is set up using `htpasswd`.

#### **1.2 Set Up Authentication**

Generate an `htpasswd` file for authentication.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/registry/auth
docker run --entrypoint htpasswd registry:2 -Bbn yourusername yourpassword > /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd
```

- Replace `yourusername` and `yourpassword` with your desired credentials.

---

### **Step 2: Create a New Website in CloudPanel**

#### **2.1 Log in to CloudPanel**

- Access CloudPanel via `https://your-server-ip:8443`.
- Use your admin credentials to log in.

#### **2.2 Add a New Website**

- Navigate to **Websites** in the left menu.
- Click **Add Website**.
- **Fill in the Details**:
  - **Customer**: Select or create a customer.
  - **Domain**: Enter your subdomain (e.g., `registry.example.com`).
  - **System User**: Accept default or specify (used for file ownership).
  - **Type**: Choose **Static** (we will modify the Nginx config).
  - **Web Server**: Select **Nginx**.
  - **Enable SSL**: We'll enable SSL after setting up the reverse proxy.
- Click **Add Website**.

---

### **Step 3: Configure Nginx in CloudPanel**

We need to set up Nginx to proxy requests to the Docker registry.

#### **3.1 Access Custom Nginx Configuration**

- In CloudPanel, go to **Websites** and select your newly created website (`registry.example.com`).
- Navigate to **Settings** or **Options** (depending on your CloudPanel version).
- Look for **Custom Nginx Configuration** or **Custom Config**.

#### **3.2 Add Reverse Proxy Configuration**

Add the following configuration to the **Custom Nginx Configuration**:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    client_max_body_size 0;  # Allow large uploads
    proxy_read_timeout 900;
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `proxy_pass`: Forwards requests to the Docker registry.
  - `proxy_set_header`: Sets necessary headers.
  - `client_max_body_size 0`: Removes upload size limits.
  - `proxy_read_timeout 900`: Extends timeout for large uploads.

#### **3.3 Save and Apply Configuration**

- Save the custom configuration.
- CloudPanel should reload Nginx automatically. If not, reload Nginx manually:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### **Step 4: Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt via CloudPanel**

#### **4.1 Obtain an SSL Certificate**

- Go back to your website in CloudPanel.
- Navigate to **SSL Certificates**.
- Click **Add SSL Certificate**.
- **Type**: Choose **Let's Encrypt**.
- **Domains**: Ensure your subdomain is listed.
- **Auto-Renewal**: Enable if desired.
- Click **Save**.

#### **4.2 CloudPanel Will Configure SSL**

- CloudPanel will automatically obtain and install the SSL certificate.
- Wait for the confirmation message.

---

### **Step 5: Test and Verify the Setup**

#### **5.1 Test Access to the Registry**

On a client machine (could be your local machine), try to log in to your registry:

```bash
docker login registry.example.com
```

- Enter the username and password you set up earlier.
- If successful, you should see a **Login Succeeded** message.

#### **5.2 Push an Image to the Registry**

```bash
docker pull alpine
docker tag alpine registry.example.com/alpine
docker push registry.example.com/alpine
```

- The image should push successfully.

#### **5.3 Pull the Image from the Registry**

```bash
docker pull registry.example.com/alpine
```

- The image should pull successfully.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Authentication Issues**

If you encounter authentication errors, ensure the `Authorization` header is forwarded.

Update your **Custom Nginx Configuration**:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    client_max_body_size 0;
    proxy_read_timeout 900;
}
```

- **Note**: The line `proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;` forwards the `Authorization` header to the backend.

#### **SSL Certificate Issues**

- Ensure your DNS records are correctly pointing to your server.
- Check that port 80 and 443 are open in your firewall.
- Verify that the domain in CloudPanel matches your subdomain.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

#### **Security**

- **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure that only necessary ports are open.
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
  sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your system and Docker images updated.
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  docker pull registry:2
  ```

#### **Persistent Data**

- **Data Volume**: Ensure the registry data is persisted.
  - Data directory: `/opt/registry/data`
- **Backups**: Regularly back up your registry data.

#### **Scaling**

- For high availability or load balancing, consider more advanced setups.

---

### **Summary**

By following these steps, you've:

- Set up a Docker registry running locally on your server.
- Configured CloudPanel to reverse proxy requests from your subdomain to the Docker registry.
- Secured your subdomain with SSL using Let's Encrypt via CloudPanel.
- Enabled authentication for secure access to your Docker registry.
- Tested and verified that you can push and pull images using your new setup.

---

## **Need Further Assistance?**

If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask for help. Provide any error messages or logs for more precise troubleshooting.

Certainly! If port **5000** is already in use by another container, you can configure your Docker registry to use port **5555** instead. This requires updating both the Docker registry's port mapping and the Nginx reverse proxy configuration in CloudPanel. Below are the updated steps to set up your Docker registry on port **5555**.

---

## **Updated Steps to Expose the Docker Registry on Port 5555**

### **Overview**

1. **Run the Docker Registry on Port 5555**
2. **Configure Nginx in CloudPanel to Use Port 5555**
3. **Test and Verify the Setup**

---

### **Step 1: Run the Docker Registry on Port 5555**

#### **1.1 Stop and Remove Any Existing Registry Container**

If you have a registry container running on port 5000, stop and remove it:

```bash
docker stop registry
docker rm registry
```

#### **1.2 Run the Docker Registry Container on Port 5555**

Run the Docker registry container, mapping port **5555** on localhost to port **5000** inside the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000 \
  -v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /opt/registry/auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `-p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000`: Binds port **5555** on `localhost` to port **5000** inside the container.
  - The rest of the command remains the same as before.

#### **1.3 Verify the Registry is Running on Port 5555**

Confirm that the registry is running and listening on port **5555**:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the registry container with the port mapping `127.0.0.1:5555->5000/tcp`.

---

### **Step 2: Configure Nginx in CloudPanel to Use Port 5555**

#### **2.1 Access Custom Nginx Configuration in CloudPanel**

- **Log in to CloudPanel**: Navigate to `https://your-server-ip:8443` and log in with your admin credentials.
- **Navigate to Websites**: Click on **Websites** in the left menu.
- **Select Your Website**: Click on your subdomain (e.g., `registry.example.com`).
- **Go to Settings**: Look for **Settings**, **Options**, or **Custom Config**.

#### **2.2 Update the Reverse Proxy Configuration**

Replace or update the existing custom Nginx configuration with the following:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5555;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    client_max_body_size 0;  # Allow large uploads
    proxy_read_timeout 900;
}
```

- **Changes**:
  - Updated `proxy_pass` to point to `http://127.0.0.1:5555`.

#### **2.3 Save and Apply the Configuration**

- **Save** the updated configuration.
- CloudPanel should automatically reload Nginx. If it doesn't, manually reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### **Step 3: Test and Verify the Setup**

#### **3.1 Test Logging In to the Registry**

On a client machine, attempt to log in to your Docker registry:

```bash
docker login registry.example.com
```

- **Username**: Enter the username you set up during the registry configuration.
- **Password**: Enter the corresponding password.

You should see a **Login Succeeded** message.

#### **3.2 Push an Image to the Registry**

Test pushing an image to your registry:

```bash
docker pull alpine
docker tag alpine registry.example.com/alpine
docker push registry.example.com/alpine
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Pull**: Downloads the `alpine` image from Docker Hub.
  - **Tag**: Tags the image with your registry's URL.
  - **Push**: Uploads the image to your private registry.

#### **3.3 Pull the Image from the Registry**

Test pulling the image from your registry:

```bash
docker pull registry.example.com/alpine
```

The image should download successfully, confirming that your registry is functioning over port **5555**.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Authentication Issues**

If you encounter authentication errors, ensure that the `Authorization` header is correctly forwarded. The updated Nginx configuration includes the necessary line:

```nginx
proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
```

#### **SSL Certificate Issues**

- **DNS Configuration**: Verify that `registry.example.com` points to your server's IP address.
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure that ports **80** and **443** are open in your server's firewall.
- **SSL Certificate**: Confirm that the SSL certificate is properly installed and not expired.

#### **Docker Registry Not Accessible**

- **Container Status**: Check that the Docker registry container is running:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **Port Mapping**: Ensure the container is correctly mapped to port **5555** on `localhost`.
- **Nginx Configuration**: Double-check the custom Nginx configuration in CloudPanel.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

#### **Firewall Configuration**

Since the Docker registry is accessible only via Nginx, you don't need to open port **5555** externally. Ensure your firewall allows traffic on ports **80** and **443**:

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

#### **Security**

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your server and Docker images up to date.
- **Backup Registry Data**: Regularly back up the registry data stored in `/opt/registry/data`.

#### **Persistent Data**

Ensure that your registry data persists by correctly mounting the volume:

```bash
-v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry
```

#### **Using a Different Port Inside the Container (Optional)**

If you prefer to change the port inside the container as well, you would need to modify the registry's configuration. However, it's simpler to map a different host port to the container's existing port **5000**.

---

### **Summary**

By adjusting the Docker registry's port mapping and updating the Nginx reverse proxy configuration in CloudPanel, you've successfully reconfigured your setup to use port **5555** instead of port **5000**. This allows you to run the registry without interfering with other services using port **5000**.

---

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Certainly! I'd be happy to review your proposed Nginx virtual host configuration and provide feedback to ensure it meets your requirements for exposing the Docker registry via CloudPanel.

### **Feedback and Recommendations:**

#### **1. Proxying to the Correct Backend**

- **Comment Correction:**
  - Your configuration mentions proxying to a **Portainer** Docker container:
    ```nginx
    # Proxy pass to Portainer Docker container
    ```
  - **Recommendation:** Since you're aiming to expose the **Docker Registry** (not Portainer), you should update the comment to reflect this:
    ```nginx
    # Proxy pass to Docker Registry container
    ```

#### **2. Protocol in `proxy_pass` Directive**

- **Current Setting:**
  - ```nginx
    proxy_pass https://localhost:5555;
    ```
- **Issue:**
  - The Docker Registry is typically served over **HTTP**, not **HTTPS**, especially when it's behind a reverse proxy like Nginx handling SSL termination.
  - Using `https://` may cause unnecessary overhead or connection issues if the registry isn't set up for HTTPS.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Change to `http://`:
    ```nginx
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5555;
    ```
  - Using `127.0.0.1` can be more efficient than `localhost` as it bypasses hostname resolution.

#### **3. SSL Verification Directive**

- **Current Setting:**
  - ```nginx
    proxy_ssl_verify off;
    ```
- **Issue:**
  - This directive is only relevant when proxying to an **HTTPS** backend with SSL verification issues (e.g., self-signed certificates).
- **Recommendation:**
  - Since we're changing the `proxy_pass` to `http://`, you can remove this line:
    ```nginx
    # proxy_ssl_verify off;  # Not needed with HTTP backend
    ```

#### **4. Forwarding Authentication Headers**

- **Importance:**
  - The Docker Registry uses HTTP Basic Authentication. The `Authorization` header must be forwarded to the backend for authentication to work.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Add the following line inside the `location /` block:
    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    ```

#### **5. Handling Large File Uploads**

- **Issue:**
  - By default, Nginx limits the size of client request bodies to 1 MB (`client_max_body_size 1m;`).
  - Docker images can be significantly larger.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Set `client_max_body_size` to `0` to disable the limit or set it to a higher value:
    ```nginx
    client_max_body_size 0;  # Disable limit for large Docker images
    ```

#### **6. Increasing Read Timeout**

- **Issue:**
  - Uploading large images can take time, and the default `proxy_read_timeout` might not be sufficient.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Add or adjust the timeout:
    ```nginx
    proxy_read_timeout 900;  # Adjust the value as needed
    ```

#### **7. WebSocket Configuration**

- **Current Setting:**
  - ```nginx
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    ```
- **Issue:**
  - These settings are typically used for WebSocket connections, which are not required for the Docker Registry.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Remove these lines unless you have a specific need for them:
    ```nginx
    # proxy_http_version 1.1;
    # proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    # proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    ```

#### **8. Clean Up Unnecessary Directives**

- **Index Directive and File Check:**
  - Since you're proxying all requests to the backend, the `index` directive and file existence check are unnecessary.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Remove these lines:
    ```nginx
    # index index.html;

    # if (-f $request_filename) {
    #   break;
    # }
    ```

#### **9. Placeholders and Variable Expansion**

- **Placeholders:**
  - Your configuration contains placeholders like `{{ssl_certificate_key}}`, `{{ssl_certificate}}`, `{{root}}`, `{{nginx_access_log}}`, `{{nginx_error_log}}`, and `{{settings}}`.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Ensure that these placeholders are properly replaced with actual values or configurations by CloudPanel or your templating engine.

#### **10. Adjusting Listen Directives**

- **Current Setting:**
  - Multiple `listen` directives with `quic`, `ssl`, `http2`, and `http3` configurations.
- **Issue:**
  - Unless you specifically require QUIC and HTTP/3, these directives can be simplified.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Simplify the `listen` directives:
    ```nginx
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    ```
  - Remove `http3` and `quic` unless you have configured Nginx to support them.

#### **11. HTTPS Redirection**

- **Current Setting:**
  - Using an `if` statement to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- **Issue:**
  - Using `if` in Nginx can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Use a separate server block for HTTP redirection:
    ```nginx
    server {
      listen 80;
      listen [::]:80;
      server_name docker.desigeek.com;
      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
    ```
  - Then, have your main server block handle HTTPS only.

#### **12. Final Adjusted Configuration**

Combining all recommendations, here's the adjusted Nginx configuration:

---

**HTTP Redirection Server Block:**

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name docker.desigeek.com;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

**HTTPS Server Block:**

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  server_name docker.desigeek.com;

  # SSL Certificates
  ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;

  # SSL Settings
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

  # Access and Error Logs
  access_log /var/log/nginx/docker.desigeek.com.access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/docker.desigeek.com.error.log;

  # Include Global Settings (if applicable)
  include /etc/nginx/global_settings;

  # Proxy to Docker Registry
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5555;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    client_max_body_size 0;
    proxy_read_timeout 900;
  }

  # Allow Let's Encrypt Verification
  location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    root /var/www/letsencrypt;
    allow all;
  }
}
```

---

**Notes:**

- **SSL Certificates:** Replace `/path/to/fullchain.pem` and `/path/to/privkey.pem` with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and key files.
- **Global Settings:** Ensure that `/etc/nginx/global_settings` exists and contains appropriate configurations.
- **Let's Encrypt Directory:** The `root` directive in the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` location should point to the directory where Let's Encrypt places challenge files.
  - If using CloudPanel's automated SSL, this might be managed automatically.
- **Removed Unnecessary Directives:** The `index` directive and the `if` condition checking for `$request_filename` are unnecessary for a proxy configuration.

---

### **Additional Considerations:**

#### **1. Authentication Security**

- Ensure that your `htpasswd` file used for Docker Registry authentication is secure and stored in a protected directory.
- Use strong, unique passwords for your registry users.

#### **2. Firewall Settings**

- Verify that your firewall (e.g., UFW) allows incoming traffic on ports **80** (HTTP) and **443** (HTTPS):
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
  ```

#### **3. Testing the Configuration**

- **Syntax Check:**
  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  ```
  - This command checks the Nginx configuration for syntax errors.
- **Reload Nginx:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
  - Reloads Nginx to apply the new configuration.

#### **4. Client Configuration**

- When pushing to or pulling from your Docker Registry, ensure that your Docker clients are configured to trust your registry's SSL certificate, especially if it's self-signed.

#### **5. Docker Client Commands**

- **Login:**
  ```bash
  docker login docker.desigeek.com
  ```
- **Tag and Push an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker tag my-image:latest docker.desigeek.com/my-image:latest
  docker push docker.desigeek.com/my-image:latest
  ```
- **Pull an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker pull docker.desigeek.com/my-image:latest
  ```

#### **6. Monitoring and Logs**

- **Access Logs:** Monitor `/var/log/nginx/docker.desigeek.com.access.log` for client access information.
- **Error Logs:** Check `/var/log/nginx/docker.desigeek.com.error.log` for any issues.

#### **7. Security Headers (Optional)**

- Consider adding security headers to enhance the security of your site:
  ```nginx
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
  add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
  add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
  ```

#### **8. Upstream Keepalive (Optional)**

- For performance optimization, you can add keepalive connections to the upstream server:
  ```nginx
  upstream docker_registry {
    server 127.0.0.1:5555;
    keepalive 16;
  }

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://docker_registry;
    ...
  }
  ```

---

### **Conclusion:**

Your initial configuration was a solid starting point, but with the above adjustments, it should now be better suited for exposing your Docker Registry through Nginx via CloudPanel. These changes address protocol mismatches, authentication header forwarding, and unnecessary directives, ensuring a more secure and efficient setup.

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Implement the Adjusted Configuration:**
   - Update your Nginx configuration file with the recommended changes.
   - Ensure all placeholders are correctly replaced with actual values.

2. **Test the Setup:**
   - Restart Nginx and test accessing the registry from a Docker client.
   - Verify that you can log in, push, and pull images successfully.

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Keep an eye on access and error logs for any anomalies.

4. **Backup Configuration:**
   - Before making changes, back up your existing Nginx configuration files.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with any part of this process, feel free to ask!

Certainly! To set up authentication for your Docker registry, you'll need to create an `htpasswd` file that contains the username and password you want to use. Since you've already run the Docker registry container with authentication enabled but haven't set up the credentials yet, follow these steps to create the `htpasswd` file and set up your username and password.

---

### **Step 1: Install the `htpasswd` Utility**

The `htpasswd` utility is used to create and update the flat files used to store usernames and password for basic authentication of HTTP users. If you don't have it installed, you can install it as follows:

#### **For Ubuntu/Debian Systems:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils -y
```

#### **For CentOS/RHEL Systems:**

```bash
sudo yum install httpd-tools -y
```

---

### **Step 2: Create the Authentication Directory**

Ensure the directory `/opt/registry/auth` exists, as you've mapped it in your `docker run` command.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/registry/auth
```

---

### **Step 3: Generate the `htpasswd` File with Username and Password**

Use the `htpasswd` utility to create the `htpasswd` file and add your user credentials.

#### **If Creating the `htpasswd` File for the First Time:**

Replace `yourusername` with your desired username.

```bash
sudo htpasswd -Bc /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd yourusername
```

- `-B` specifies bcrypt encryption (more secure).
- `-c` creates a new file. Omit `-c` if you're adding to an existing file.

You'll be prompted to enter and confirm your password.

#### **If Adding Additional Users:**

```bash
sudo htpasswd -B /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd anotheruser
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify the `htpasswd` File**

Ensure the `htpasswd` file has been created and contains your user:

```bash
cat /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd
```

You should see entries like:

```
yourusername:$2y$05$...
```

---

### **Step 5: Restart the Docker Registry Container**

Since the `htpasswd` file was not present when you first started the container, you need to restart the container to apply authentication.

#### **Stop and Remove the Existing Container:**

```bash
docker stop registry
docker rm registry
```

#### **Run the Registry Container Again:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000 \
  -v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /opt/registry/auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

---

### **Step 6: Test the Registry Authentication from the Client Machine**

Now that the registry is running with authentication, you can test logging in from your client machine.

#### **6.1 Log In to Your Registry**

Replace `docker.desigeek.com` with your registry's domain or IP address.

```bash
docker login docker.desigeek.com
```

When prompted, enter the username and password you set earlier.

```plaintext
Username: yourusername
Password: ******
```

If successful, you'll see:

```plaintext
Login Succeeded
```

#### **6.2 Push an Image to Your Registry**

##### **Pull a Base Image**

```bash
docker pull alpine
```

##### **Tag the Image with Your Registry's Address**

```bash
docker tag alpine docker.desigeek.com/my-alpine
```

##### **Push the Image**

```bash
docker push docker.desigeek.com/my-alpine
```

#### **6.3 Pull the Image from Your Registry**

```bash
docker pull docker.desigeek.com/my-alpine
```

---

### **Additional Considerations**

#### **1. SSL Certificates**

Since you're accessing the registry over HTTPS, ensure that your SSL certificates are properly set up and trusted by the client machine.

- **Self-Signed Certificates:**
  - If using self-signed certificates, you may need to configure your Docker client to trust them.
  - Copy the registry's CA certificate to `/etc/docker/certs.d/docker.desigeek.com/ca.crt` on the client machine.

#### **2. Verify Firewall Settings**

Ensure that your server's firewall allows traffic on the necessary ports:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

#### **3. Permissions**

Ensure that the Docker daemon can read the `htpasswd` file:

```bash
sudo chown -R root:root /opt/registry/auth
sudo chmod 644 /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd
```

#### **4. Updating Users**

To add or remove users later, update the `htpasswd` file and restart the registry container.

**Add a User:**

```bash
sudo htpasswd -B /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd newuser
```

**Remove a User:**

```bash
sudo htpasswd -D /opt/registry/auth/htpasswd unwanteduser
```

**Restart the Container:**

```bash
docker restart registry
```

---

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Issue: Login Fails with Unauthorized Error**

- **Cause:** The client is not sending the correct authentication headers, or the username/password is incorrect.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure you're using the correct username and password.
  - Verify that the `Authorization` header is being forwarded in your Nginx configuration. Your Nginx `location` block should include:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    ```

#### **Issue: SSL Certificate Issues**

- **Cause:** The client doesn't trust the SSL certificate used by the registry.
- **Solution:**
  - If using a self-signed certificate, add it to the Docker client's trusted certificates.
  - For Linux:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/docker.desigeek.com
    sudo cp /path/to/ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/docker.desigeek.com/ca.crt
    ```

  - Restart the Docker service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

#### **Issue: "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" Error**

- **Solution:**
  - This is due to the Docker client not trusting the registry's SSL certificate.
  - Add the registry's certificate to the client's trusted certificates as shown above.

---

### **Summary**

By creating the `htpasswd` file and restarting the Docker registry container, you've set up basic HTTP authentication for your Docker registry. Now you can securely log in, push, and pull images from your private registry.

---

If you have any further questions or need assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask!

No, the `docker run` command you provided does not include a restart policy, so the Docker registry container will **not** automatically restart if the machine reboots or if the Docker daemon restarts. By default, Docker containers do not restart automatically unless specified.

To ensure that your Docker registry container starts automatically after a system reboot, you need to include the `--restart` flag with an appropriate restart policy in your `docker run` command.

---

### **Understanding Docker Restart Policies**

Docker provides several restart policies that determine whether a container should be restarted when it exits or when Docker itself restarts:

- `no` (default): Do not automatically restart the container.
- `on-failure[:max-retries]`: Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code. Optionally, you can specify the maximum number of times Docker will try to restart the container.
- `always`: Always restart the container regardless of the exit status. If the container was manually stopped, it will be restarted only when Docker daemon restarts or the container is manually started.
- `unless-stopped`: Similar to `always`, except that when the container is explicitly stopped, it is not restarted even after Docker daemon restarts.

---

### **Modify the `docker run` Command to Include a Restart Policy**

To have your Docker registry container restart automatically on system reboot, you should include the `--restart` flag with either the `always` or `unless-stopped` policy.

Here's how you can modify your `docker run` command:

#### **Option 1: Using `--restart unless-stopped`**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000 \
  -v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /opt/registry/auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `--restart unless-stopped`: The container will always restart unless it is explicitly stopped. It will also restart when the Docker daemon starts (e.g., after a system reboot).

#### **Option 2: Using `--restart always`**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  --restart always \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000 \
  -v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /opt/registry/auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `--restart always`: The container will always restart regardless of the exit status, including when the Docker daemon starts after a system reboot.

**Note**: Both `always` and `unless-stopped` policies will restart the container on system reboot. The difference lies in how they handle manual stops:

- With `always`, if you manually stop the container using `docker stop`, it will still be restarted when the Docker daemon restarts.
- With `unless-stopped`, if you manually stop the container, it will not be restarted on Docker daemon restart until you start it manually.

---

### **Updating the Restart Policy of an Existing Container**

If you have already created the container without a restart policy, you don't need to remove and recreate it. You can update the restart policy using the `docker update` command:

```bash
docker update --restart unless-stopped registry
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This command updates the `registry` container to use the `unless-stopped` restart policy.

---

### **Verify the Restart Policy**

You can verify that the restart policy has been set by inspecting the container:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{ .HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name }}' registry
```

- **Expected Output**:
  - It should display `unless-stopped` or `always` depending on what you set.

---

### **Testing the Restart Policy**

To test whether the container restarts automatically:

1. **Reboot Your System**:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. **After Reboot, Check if the Container is Running**:

   ```bash
   docker ps | grep registry
   ```

   - If the container is listed, it has successfully restarted.

---

### **Additional Recommendations**

#### **1. Logging**

- Consider setting up logging options to monitor the container's behavior after restarts.

  ```bash
  --log-opt max-size=10m \
  --log-opt max-file=3 \
  ```

- Example:

  ```bash
  docker run -d \
    --name registry \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --log-opt max-size=10m \
    --log-opt max-file=3 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000 \
    ...
    registry:2
  ```

#### **2. Monitoring**

- Implement monitoring to ensure that your registry is functioning correctly after restarts.
- Use tools like Docker's built-in health checks or external monitoring solutions.

#### **3. Backup Registry Data**

- Since your registry data is stored in `/opt/registry/data`, ensure regular backups to prevent data loss.

#### **4. Updating the Docker Registry Image**

- Periodically update the Docker registry image to the latest version to receive security updates and new features.

  ```bash
  docker pull registry:2
  docker stop registry
  docker rm registry
  # Run the docker run command again with the updated image
  ```

---

### **Summary**

- By adding the `--restart` flag with an appropriate policy to your `docker run` command, you ensure that the Docker registry container will automatically restart after a system reboot.
- You can use `--restart unless-stopped` or `--restart always` depending on your preference.
- If you already have the container running, you can update its restart policy using `docker update`.

---

### **Example of the Complete `docker run` Command with Restart Policy**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5555:5000 \
  -v /opt/registry/data:/var/lib/registry \
  -v /opt/registry/auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
  registry:2
```

It appears you're encountering an error when trying to push your `pfoaas` image to your private Docker registry:

```
docker push docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
The push refers to repository [docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas]
tag does not exist: docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
```

**Explanation of the Error:**

The error message indicates that the Docker daemon cannot find a local image tagged as `docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev`. Docker requires the image to be tagged with the registry's address before it can be pushed.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you need to correctly tag your local image with your private registry's address before pushing it. Here's how you can do it:

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Verify Your Local Images**

First, check the list of images you have locally to see how your `pfoaas` image is currently tagged.

```bash
docker images
```

Look for your image in the output. It might be tagged as `amitbahree/pfoaas:dev` or something similar.

#### **2. Tag the Image with Your Registry Address**

You need to tag your local image with the full path to your private registry, including the registry domain, repository, and tag.

Assuming your local image is tagged as `amitbahree/pfoaas:dev`, run:

```bash
docker tag amitbahree/pfoaas:dev docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
```

**Explanation:**

- `docker tag [source_image] [target_image]`
- This command creates a new tag (`docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev`) pointing to the existing image (`amitbahree/pfoaas:dev`).

#### **3. Log In to Your Private Registry**

Make sure you're authenticated with your private registry.

```bash
docker login docker.desigeek.com
```

Enter your username and password when prompted.

#### **4. Push the Image to Your Private Registry**

Now that the image is correctly tagged, you can push it:

```bash
docker push docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
```

Docker will upload the image layers to your private registry.

#### **5. Verify the Push**

You can verify that the image has been pushed successfully by pulling it on another machine:

```bash
docker pull docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
```

---

### **Additional Information**

#### **Building the Image with the Correct Tag Initially**

To streamline the process in the future, you can build the image with the correct tag from the beginning:

```bash
docker build -t docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev .
```

This way, you won't need to retag the image before pushing.

#### **Understanding Docker Image Tags**

Docker uses image tags to identify images and where they should be pushed or pulled from. The general format is:

```
[registry_address]/[user_or_org]/[repository_name]:[tag]
```

- **registry_address**: The domain of your Docker registry (`docker.desigeek.com`).
- **user_or_org**: Your Docker username or organization (`amitbahree`).
- **repository_name**: The name of your image (`pfoaas`).
- **tag**: The version or variant of your image (`dev`).

#### **Common Pitfalls**

- **Forgetting to Tag with the Registry Address**: Docker won't push images unless they are tagged with the registry address.
- **Incorrect Login**: Ensure you're logged into the correct registry (`docker.desigeek.com`).
- **Typos in Tag Names**: Double-check the spelling of your tags and repository names.

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Build the Image with the Correct Tag**

   ```bash
   docker build -t docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev .
   ```

2. **Log In to Your Private Registry**

   ```bash
   docker login docker.desigeek.com
   ```

3. **Push the Image**

   ```bash
   docker push docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
   ```

4. **Pull the Image (Optional, for Verification)**

   ```bash
   docker pull docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev
   ```

---

### **Summary**

The error occurs because Docker can't find an image tagged as `docker.desigeek.com/amitbahree/pfoaas:dev` locally. By properly tagging your image with your registry's address, Docker knows where to push it.
