These additions should provide a richer set of sarcastic and humorous responses for your API users to enjoy. Feel free to adjust the messages to better fit the tone and style of your service.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Customization**: Allow users to include both a `:name` and a `:from` parameter to personalize the messages.
- **Localization**: Consider adding support for multiple languages to reach a broader audience.
- **Randomization**: Implement an endpoint that returns a random sarcastic remark from your collection.
- **Theming**: Group similar operations under themes like "Encouragement," "Compliments," or "Advice" for easier navigation.

**Example Usage with Parameters:**

- **Endpoint**: `/backhanded/:name/:from`
- **Example**: `/backhanded/Alex/Chris`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "I'm impressed by how confidently you speak about things you clearly know nothing about, Alex.",
    "from": "Chris"
  }
  ```

This approach enhances user engagement by allowing for more personalized and interactive experiences.
